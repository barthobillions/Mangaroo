# MangaReader
This program downloads a specified manga, and allows the user to read the manga through a PYQT5 GUI.
The only site the program parses is manganato; I will be adding more site compatibilities

GUI functionality is now fully working. Entire program can be used through the GUI and not the command line.

*DO NOT TOUCH THE DATA FILE*
